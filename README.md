# Recursive-LL-Parser

This is a simple LL parser that takes an Extended BNF and recursively analyzes it from left to right.

LL Parser: In computer science, an LL parser is a top-down parser for a subset of context-free languages. It parses the input from Left to right, performing Leftmost derivation of the sentence.

EBNF: In computer science, extended Backusâ€“Naur form (EBNF) is a family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to express a context-free grammar. EBNF is used to make a formal description of a formal language which can be a computer programming language.
